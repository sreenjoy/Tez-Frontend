# Tez.social Optimization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for optimizing the Tez.social application to improve performance, maintainability, and code quality while preserving the existing UI and functionality.

## Goals
- Improve page load and interaction performance
- Reduce bundle size
- Eliminate code duplication
- Improve component reusability
- Maintain visual and functional parity
- Follow React and Next.js best practices
- Enhance maintainability for future development

## Benchmark Documentation
Before making any changes, we've created detailed benchmarks for each page:
- [Authentication Benchmark](./AUTH-BENCHMARK.md)
- [Organization Info Benchmark](./ORGANIZATION-INFO-BENCHMARK.md)
- [Pipeline Benchmark](./PIPELINE-BENCHMARK.md)
- [Dashboard Benchmark](./DASHBOARD-BENCHMARK.md)

These benchmarks include visual references, performance metrics, component hierarchies, and functionality checklists that will serve as our reference points throughout the optimization process.

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Code Analysis
- Analyze bundle size and identify largest contributors
- Profile render performance to detect excessive re-renders
- Identify duplicate code and styling
- Review component structure for optimization opportunities
- Examine data fetching patterns

### 2. Component Architecture Improvements
- Extract reusable components to shared location
- Implement proper component composition
- Apply React.memo where beneficial
- Convert class components to functional components with hooks
- Use React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting

### 3. State Management Optimization
- Optimize context usage to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use useCallback and useMemo for expensive operations
- Implement proper state lifting
- Consider more efficient state management like Zustand if needed

### 4. CSS Optimization
- Consolidate duplicate styles
- Remove unused CSS
- Replace imperative style manipulations with CSS variables
- Optimize Tailwind usage
- Consider CSS-in-JS optimization if applicable

### 5. Performance Enhancements
- Implement virtualization for long lists (Pipeline, Activity Feed)
- Optimize data fetching with SWR or React Query
- Improve loading and error states
- Add proper skeleton loaders
- Optimize images and assets

### 6. Code Quality Improvements
- Standardize naming conventions
- Improve TypeScript typing
- Add or improve comments for complex logic
- Create proper abstractions for repeated logic
- Improve error handling

## Implementation Approach

We will take a page-by-page approach to optimization:

1. **Authentication Pages**
   - Optimize form handling
   - Improve validation logic
   - Enhance state management

2. **Organization Info Page**
   - Optimize multi-step form
   - Improve data persistence
   - Enhance validation

3. **Pipeline Page**
   - Optimize drag and drop performance
   - Improve card rendering efficiency
   - Enhance filtering and search performance

4. **Dashboard Page**
   - Optimize chart rendering
   - Improve data fetching strategy
   - Enhance rendering of dynamic content

## Verification Process

For each optimization:
1. Compare visual output to benchmarks
2. Verify all functionality works as expected
3. Measure performance improvements
4. Confirm responsive behavior
5. Test in both light and dark modes

## Backup Strategy

Before optimizing each page:
1. Create backup of current implementation
2. Document specific changes being made
3. Maintain ability to revert to original implementation

## Timeline and Priorities

1. Pipeline Page (high priority)
   - Highest complexity
   - Most performance-sensitive

2. Authentication Pages (medium priority)
   - Critical for user experience
   - Relatively simple to optimize

3. Organization Info Page (medium priority)
   - Important for onboarding
   - Focused optimization scope

4. Dashboard Page (medium-high priority)
   - Complex data visualization
   - Multiple optimization opportunities
