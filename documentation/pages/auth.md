## Technical Implementation

The Authentication page implements several security technologies and best practices:

- **Secure Communications**: All authentication occurs over HTTPS with TLS 1.3
- **Password Security**: 
  - Bcrypt hashing with appropriate work factors
  - Salting for protection against rainbow table attacks
  - No plaintext password storage or transmission
- **JWT Implementation**: Secure token-based authentication after initial login
- **CSRF Protection**: Prevention of cross-site request forgery attacks
- **XSS Mitigation**: Content security policies and output sanitization
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of brute force and denial-of-service attacks
- **OAuth 2.0 Flows**: Standard-compliant implementation for SSO options

The page is built using Next.js and React, with responsive design principles to ensure accessibility across devices. Form state management is handled with React hooks, and validation is performed both client-side (for user experience) and server-side (for security).

## Best Practices

- **Use a Strong Password**: Create passwords with at least 12 characters including upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Add an extra layer of security to your account
- **Use Unique Passwords**: Avoid reusing passwords across different services
- **Watch for Phishing**: Always verify you're on the correct domain before entering credentials
- **Regular Device Logout**: Sign out from shared or public devices after use
- **Password Manager Integration**: Consider using a password manager for secure credential storage
- **Check Login Notifications**: Review email notifications about new logins to your account
- **Update Contact Information**: Keep your recovery email and phone number up to date

## Organization-Specific Authentication

For enterprise customers, the Authentication page supports:

- **Custom Branding**: Organization logo and color scheme
- **Domain Restrictions**: Limiting registration to specific email domains
- **SSO Enforcement**: Requiring use of corporate identity providers
- **Role-Based Access**: Integration with role management systems
