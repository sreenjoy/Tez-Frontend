## Technical Implementation

The AI Assistant page integrates several advanced technologies:

- **AI API Integration**: Connects to Large Language Models (Claude or GPT) through secure API channels
- **Context Management**: Injects relevant pipeline and organization context into AI prompts
- **Feedback Processing**: Processes user feedback to improve response quality over time
- **Data Security**: Implements encryption and privacy controls for sensitive information
- **Caching Layer**: Optimizes performance by caching common queries and responses

The page leverages the application's PipelineContext to ensure AI responses are relevant to the current pipeline selection, providing contextually appropriate answers based on the user's focus area.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Training**: Keep the AI up-to-date with the latest product information and sales strategies
- **Diverse Examples**: Provide a wide range of example questions and answers for more comprehensive training
- **Consistent Feedback**: Regularly review and provide feedback on AI responses to improve accuracy
- **Context Awareness**: Specify the pipeline or context when asking questions for more relevant answers
- **Privacy Consciousness**: Be mindful of what information is shared with the AI, especially regarding customer data
- **Team Collaboration**: Share valuable AI responses with team members to maximize knowledge distribution
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use the analytics to identify and address areas where the AI needs enhancement

## API Configuration (for "Bring Your Own Key" option)

For users who choose to use their own Claude or GPT API key:

- **API Settings**: Configure API provider, key storage, and model selection
- **Usage Limits**: Set rate limits and token budgets to control costs
- **Custom System Prompts**: Configure organization-specific base prompts
- **Security Settings**: Manage how API keys are stored and accessed
- **Logging Preferences**: Control what interactions are logged for future training
